# Deus Coding Challenge

This is my React coding challenge for Deus. A gallery of items coming from an API call. You can delete and create items only changing the actual state, no API calls.

## Installation

Install project dependencies with npm

```bash
  npm install
```

## Run Project

run the project with npm

```bash
  npm start
```

## Demo

## Roadmap

- Make a Api call to map the response and print the gallery with the results

- Make a component to manage the routes.

- Make a component to print every single item in the API response.

- Make an input to search among all the elements returned by the api.

- Make two buttons at the end of the gallery to paginate forward and backward.

- Make a state to delete every single item by clicking it.

- Make a component to display the detail of every single item comming from the API

- Make a header/Nav bar with the Deus logo to navigate to "/" and the diferent pages.

- Make a component to post a new item. It uses React Hook Form and send the info to the same component who printed the gallery to reuse it.

- Make media queries for correct display at mobile devices
